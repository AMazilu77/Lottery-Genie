 <p> <b>1.</b> Select the amount you want to play <b>(Pick two numbers between 0-9)</b>: 50 cents or $1 (all
      Straight/Box and 1-OFF plays cost $1). </p>
   
   <p><b>2.</b> There are two drawings per day seven days per week, at approximately <b>1:30 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. ET.</b>
      Tickets for
      each drawing can be purchased up to 13 minutes prior to the applicable drawing – 1:17 p.m. ET for the midday
      drawings and 9:32 p.m. ET for the evening drawings.</p>    
       <p><b>3.</b> Select the draw time. Select MID for the midday drawing (1:30
      p.m. ET), EVE for the evening drawing (9:45p.m. ET) draw, or BOTH for both the midday and evening drawings. If no

      one for the midday drawing and one for the evening drawing.</p>

    <p>You can win a top prize of <b>$50 </b>with a $1 Straight play, or increase your chances of winning with a Box,
