 <p> <b>1.</b> Select the amount you want to play <b>(Pick two numbers between 0-9)</b>: 50 cents or $1 (all
      Straight/Box and 1-OFF plays cost $1). </p>
   
   <p><b>2.</b> There are two drawings per day seven days per week, at approximately <b>1:30 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. ET.</b>
      Tickets for each drawing can be purchased up to 13 minutes prior to the applicable drawing – 1:17 p.m. ET for the midday
      drawings and 9:32 p.m. ET for the evening drawings.</p>    
       <p><b>3.</b> Select the draw time. Select MID for the midday drawing (1:30 p.m. ET), EVE for the evening drawing (9:45p.m. ET) draw, or BOTH for both the midday and evening drawings. If no
      draw time is marked, the terminal will automatically print a ticket for the next available draw. If BOTH is selected, two separate tickets will print –
      one for the midday drawing and one for the evening drawing.</p>

    <p>You can win a top prize of <b>$500 </b>with a $1 Straight play, or increase your chances of winning with a Box, Straight/Box, Front/Back Number or 1-OFF play.</p>

    <p><b>Reminder: Prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the draw date.</b>
      All PICK 2 prizes may be claimed at any authorized Florida Lottery retailer.</p>

  <div odds>
    <p> <b>1.</b> Strait: Match numbers in exact order. 1$ strait play pays off $500.00 with odds of 1 : 1000 </p>

  <br>

  <p> The odds of winning a lottery game like this is the <b>"1:1000"</b> odds. It
    means that if you played the game 1000 times, you should expect, on average to win once. This ratio of <b>"1:1000"</b>
    can also be expressed as <b>1/1000</b> or <b>1 out of 1000</b></p>
  </div>

  <div theory>
    <p>This game has low variance and fast feedback. You can apply frequency tracking, trailing digit avoidance, and rolling analysis across day/night draws.</p>
